# Problem decomposition

Before implementing changes, explicitly decompose the problem.

- Identify the core objective.
- Separate essential requirements from incidental details.
- Identify constraints (technical, security, architectural, performance).
- Prefer solving the smallest meaningful subproblem first.
- Avoid solving problems that were not explicitly asked for.

If the problem is ambiguous, clarify assumptions or ask targeted questions
before proceeding.
