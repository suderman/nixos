_Welcome to the NixOS configuration for all my personal infrastucture!_

Feel free to look around but realize this is an on-going work-in-progress.
Although I'm a Nix enthusiast, I am _not_ a Nix expert, so there's probably
always a better way to do what I'm trying to do. I have found
[Nix](https://nixos.org/) to be very challenging, but almost always in a good
way. ðŸ¤“

This is a work-in-progress as I migrate from
[legacy branch](https://github.com/suderman/nixos/tree/legacy).

When trying to figure out how to do something, examples are almost always best.
Make use of GitHub's search with the code language filter to find examples from
other Nix users' personal configurations.

For example, here is `config.services.nginx`:
